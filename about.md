# Reflection

My top carrer is being a Chiropracter. This is my top choice because my entire life
my family always told me I was good a massaging and cracking backs. I already know
how to do most of what a Chiropracter has to do to achieve their degree and I think I 
can do well. 

This connects to my lifestyle goals because it can help me achieve my dreams of being
a Chiropracter and helping others.

This will help me succeed because I will be making money by doing something I love and
I won't get tired of it.
